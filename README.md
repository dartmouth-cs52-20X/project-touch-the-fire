# Starterpack with React, Redux, router  and image compression and optimization support. 
This starterpack has react support as well as the imagemin plugin to compress images and the url loader plugin to optimize image calls by converting a file if itâ€™s smaller than the specified size into a Base64 URL. This helps to avoid extra image requests. During testing I was able to get the 70 kb logo redcued down to a size of 19kb.
